Translate a Boolean or Discrete Dynamics Gene Regulatory/Signaling Cascade/Metabolic Network model into a Semicontinuous one using Glass Dynamics and parameter optimization techniques.
Currently, the program is in active development. The discrete model being transformed is a signaling network related to sea urchin sperm motility. (Publication information will be added later. As of this moment, the manuscript describing that model and some cool results has been accepted for publication in PLoS ONE).
